# Title (replace with your title)

This document serves as a guide to understanding regular expressions (regex) in the context of a NoSQL social network application. Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation, and they can be especially useful in scenarios where data is stored in a flexible schema, as is common in NoSQL databases.



## Summary

In this guide, we will explore various components of regular expressions and how they can be applied in the context of a NoSQL social network. We will provide explanations and examples for different regex components, such as anchors, quantifiers, character classes, flags, grouping and capturing, bracket expressions, greedy and lazy matching, boundaries, back-references, and look-ahead and look-behind assertions.
